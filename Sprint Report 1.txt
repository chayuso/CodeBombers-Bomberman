Project We Chose: Bomberman

Why We Chose It: We found that our team members are all familiar with Bomberman and 
this allows us to discuss possible high-level design choices for creating an effective 
client-server architecture. We also chose to use JavaScript, HTML and a C server 
because we are more familiar with designing network games with a client server 
architecture using these programming languages. 

Source code We Found: 
21st-century-bomberman - https://github.com/chaficnajjar/21st-century-bomberman

Our Plans for the Following Two Weeks: 
We will and have began discussing the possible problems with certain implementations. 
Also, our group plans on meeting 3 times a week to further create the design document 
for Sprint 2A. We plan on moving most of the JavaScript game logic into a C server 
to create either a thin client server architecture where the client only has to worry 
about rendering, or a hybrid of logic left in clients based on discussed design 
decisions.
