What was accomplished this sprint:
Clients simulated game in html programmed in JavaScript and connect to a server,
programmed in C++, using its ip address and port. Created a hybrid network 
architecture where client movement is computed locally for their player and
positions are sent on an interval along with latency calculations to the server. 
Bombs are synced with the client requesting a bomb to be placed in the position
they were requested in, the server then sends to both clients along with the time 
it was initially placed so bombs explode at the same time. Bomb exploding and wall 
breaking is calculated by the client. Clients check their own death and send to 
the server a death event for their character. Game start, restart, and game over 
screens are synced. Game logic and state was also translated to server.  

Our Plans for the Following Sprint: 
Move our database to a more refined system such as SQL. hosted on a ICS server.  
We also plan on implementing interpolation between clients to smoothing out 
position syncing rather than teleporting. We also plan on better syncing item 
collecting so latency won't cause problems. Another latency issue we wish to 
mediate is having a timeout when the client is experiencing high latency and 
hasn't received a response from the server from the latency estimation interval, 
in which the clients position will locally roll back to their last sent position. 
Lastly, we wish to include more than two players, up to four, as we prepare to
develop multiple game sessions.
