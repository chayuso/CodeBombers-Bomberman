What was accomplished this sprint:
Player 3 and 4 are able to connect to the server and play. 
Bombs and movements are synced on all 4 players Power ups 
and game over condition are synced for 2 player games.. 
Server is able to tell which client is the first to get 
the powerup. If powerup is given to the wrong player, due 
to latency and timestamp check, the server would reduce 
it from the wrong player and give it to the correct player. 
We also made our server run on an ics server instead of our 
own computer and have a MySQL database hosted on ics server.

Our Plans for the Following Sprint: 
We plan on fixing multiple latency and connection bugs with 
the current system. Such fixes include allowing multiple 
players to be able to create a new account at once before 
being registered into the game. Another fix regarding  a 3 - 
4 player game is to sync the game over screen, including 
removing dead players, and power up pickups for players 3 and 
4 (Cannot currently pick up power ups).Bombs will also have to 
be redefined to be able to handle heavy latency, such as 
ensuring the bomb has exploded in all clients. Lastly, when 
players disconnect, server should kill the character in the 
game or end the game properly.
